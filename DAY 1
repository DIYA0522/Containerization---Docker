Docker = the most popular containerization tool, used in DevOps to build, ship, and run applications consistently across environments.

Docker is a tool/platform that makes containerization easy.
  It lets you package an application and everything it needs (dependencies, libraries, configs) into a container.
  you can run that container anywhere — your laptop, a server, or the cloud — and it will behave the same way.

Install Docker

sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker                       --telling systemd (command to manage services on Linux) to start Docker automatically on system boot.
docker --version

Run Your First Container

Test Docker installation:
docker run hello-world
This pulls a small image and prints a welcome message.

See Containers
docker ps        # running containers
docker ps -a     # all containers (including stopped)

Containers vs Images

Image = blueprint/template (read-only).
Container = running instance of an image.

docker images    # list images
docker run -it ubuntu bash   # run Ubuntu in interactive shell

Inside Ubuntu, run:
ls
pwd
exit   # to quit container
