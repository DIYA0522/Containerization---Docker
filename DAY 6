ðŸ§± What is Docker Compose?

Docker Compose is a tool that helps you define and run multi-container applications using a single YAML file (docker-compose.yml).

âœ… Instead of running many docker run commands manually,
you can describe everything (images, ports, networks, environment variables, etc.) in one file, and just run:

docker-compose up -d

Install
sudo apt install docker-compose -y
docker-compose --version

Create
mkdir ~/compose-demo
cd ~/compose-demo
Then create the YAML file:

nano docker-compose.yml
--------------
version: "3"

services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "8080:80"

  db:
    image: mysql
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
---------------
Takeaway:
web is for serving HTTP traffic externally.
db is internal, and other services (like web) can communicate with it inside the Compose network.

Run your stack
docker-compose up -d

Check running services:
docker-compose ps

âœ… Youâ€™ll see 2 containers:

compose-demo_web_1 (nginx)
compose-demo_db_1 (mysql)

Test

In your browser, go to:
http://<your-ec2-public-ip>:8080

Scale your service

Want 3 Nginx containers instead of 1?

Run:
docker-compose up --scale web=3 -d

Now check again:
docker-compose ps

Stop and remove everything

To stop containers:
docker-compose down

It removes all containers, but your data persists if volumes are defined.
