Build Docker Images

To list
docker images

To pull a popular image like
docker pull mysql

Create your own app
Make a small Python file:
echo 'print("Hello DevOps")' > app.py

Create a Dockerfile
 A Dockerfile is the recipe to build images.
 Create a file named Dockerfile (no extension):
nano Dockerfile

Paste this:

FROM python:3.9
COPY app.py /
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
--------------------------------
FROM → base image (Python 3.9 here)
COPY → copy your code into image
CMD → command to run

Save and exit

Build your image
docker build -t myapp .

-t myapp → gives your image a name (myapp)
. → means “look in current directory for Dockerfile”


Run your image
docker run myapp
You should see:
  Hello DevOps


✅ Is this always the process to build an image?

Yes, always! 🎯
Whenever you want to create your own custom image, you:
  Write a Dockerfile (the recipe).
  Run docker build (cook it into an image).
  Run docker run (serve it as a container).
